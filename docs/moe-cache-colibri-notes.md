# Ideas from JustVugg/colibri worth evaluating for moe-cache

Source: https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri (Apache-2.0, C engine + React web UI,
disk/RAM/VRAM tiered MoE inference). Not a port target as a whole — most of its
scope (disk tier, io_uring, NUMA, Metal/Vulkan backends, its own model loaders)
doesn't apply here. These are specific, small, self-contained techniques that do.

Status: research notes only, nothing implemented yet. Each needs its own A/B
against the ported moe-cache before merging — Colibri's own README is explicit
that even their validated techniques are "measurable policies, not promises."

## 1. LFRU eviction + hysteresis + decay (runtime, dynamic)

File: `c/tier.h` (~60 lines).

Our ported `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/moe-cache.cu` uses plain LRU (doubly-linked list,
evict from `lru_head` — see `moe_cache_lru_remove`/`moe_cache_lru_push_back`,
around line 452-660). Colibri instead scores each candidate with
`(heat << 8) | recency`, so frequency is primary and recency only breaks ties
(`tier_pick_lfru`), and gates every eviction behind a 25%-plus-4 hysteresis
margin so two similarly-hot experts can't ping-pong. `tier_decay()` halves heat
counters periodically so the hot set can still adapt to a workload change.

Motivation: matches the RFC's own measured routing skew (top 10% of experts
get ~80% of hits) better than plain recency. Worth A/B'ing against our LRU on
real hit-rate/decode-speed numbers before considering it.

## 2. Persistent cross-session usage history (semi-dynamic — persists across runs)

File: `c/route_trace.h`, `.coli_usage` file format.

leloch's final rework explicitly *removed* hot-set persistence to cut
maintenance burden (commit a01eb2646). Colibri kept it and the implementation
is a careful reference for doing it safely if we ever revisit that trade-off:
- versioned text format, two header records (`-1 <n_layers> <n_experts>`,
  `-2 <version> <engine_id>`) so old parsers still work on new files
- engine-identity hash in the header so one model/engine's history can't
  silently corrupt another's placement (refuses by default, explicit
  `PIN=<path>` override required)
- atomic write via `<path>.tmp` + `rename()`
- its own decay (`COLI_USAGE_DECAY`) separate from the in-memory tier decay,
  because a cumulative histogram gets less responsive as it grows (measured:
  at 18.2M selections a typical turn only moves the ranking 0.2%)

## 3. Live per-expert tier/heat heatmap ("Brain" view) — dynamic, requires a running server

File: `web/src/Brain.tsx`.

Wire format is the interesting part: `/experts` returns one **hex byte per
expert** (top 2 bits = tier, bottom 6 bits = heat), plus a separate bitset of
experts that fired since the last poll. ~39KB of text for 19,456 experts, not
JSON objects. Rendering is plain Canvas 2D (no WebGL/three.js — confirmed
absent from `package.json`): `fillRect` per cell, color = tier, brightness =
heat, and the "flash on fire" effect is a per-expert `Float32Array` pulse set
to 1.0 on a hit and decayed `*= 0.94` per animation frame. Polls every 1.5s,
not a websocket.

Only works while the server is actively running — needs a live endpoint, not
a static report. Portable version: `moe-cache.cu` already tracks
hits/misses/evictions per device (`MOE_CACHE_LOG`); extending that to
per-(layer,expert) tier+heat state, packed the same way, plus a small canvas
component in `tools/ui`, would be a scoped debugging/demo view — much smaller
than adopting Colibri's engine.

## 4. Static pre-flight resource planner — NOT dynamic, no running server needed

File: `c/resource_plan.py`, `build_plan()`.

Scans a model's tensor headers directly (no weights loaded) to get exact
per-expert-layer byte sizes, discovers hardware (RAM via /proc/meminfo or
platform equivalents, VRAM via nvidia-smi/rocm-smi, physical core count
correcting for SMT/Apple P+E cores, NUMA socket count), and computes a
**projected cache hit rate** before the model even runs — `resident_expert /
total_expert` bytes given the real VRAM+RAM budget. Correctly avoids
double-counting budget on unified-memory chips (Grace Blackwell, Jetson)
where VRAM and RAM share one physical pool.

The genuinely novel bit: it ties that projection to auto-tuning *other*
features, e.g. disabling speculative decoding when the projected regime is
compute-bound or disk-bound with low hit rate, because their own measurements
show speculation actively loses there (-42% one case, -32% another).

Portable version for us: a `llama-plan`-ish pre-flight tool — scan a GGUF's
expert tensor sizes (metadata only, fast), discover VRAM/RAM, project a hit
rate for our `--moe-cache` budget before the user runs anything. Complements
the runtime cache rather than replacing it.

## Reality check on Colibri's own numbers

Independent review (wavect.io, GLM-5.2 on consumer hardware) tempers the
README's framing considerably: cold inference on a 24GB-RAM laptop is
0.05-0.1 tok/s (one token every 10-20s) with a 3-4% expert hit rate; the
5.8-6.8 tok/s "success" case needed six RTX 5090s and 251GB RAM with all
experts VRAM-resident (60%+ hit rate) — not actually consumer hardware.
Also: single-generation only (no concurrent requests/batching), no
multimodal input. Doesn't diminish the individual techniques above (each is
small, self-contained, independently verifiable in the source) but the
engine's own headline claims are rosier than its real-world numbers -
calibrate expectations accordingly, especially for candidate #4's hit-rate
projections, which assume a use case with a large enough cache budget to
actually work.

## Already checked, no action needed

**NaN-safe router argmax** (`route_trace.h`'s `rt_router_pick`): if router
logits are ever NaN, naive argmax leaves `best = -1`, later used as an array
index / file offset — silent corruption, not a crash. Checked our
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/topk-moe.cu:136-146` — already sanitizes NaN to
`-FLT_MAX` before the iterative argmax, with a comment referencing
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/19659. Nothing to port.
